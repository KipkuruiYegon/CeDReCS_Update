        I wondered what this hacker may have done, or if I’ll be able to log in again.
        I use my computer very securely, I utilise backup services, and save almost no important data on my machine. Everything is in the cloud. So I kind of rationalised with myself that nothing bad could happen, except maybe Identity theft or similar. But why would the voice then say that everything was very transparent. Maybe he found some clues or something on my machine
        An app with a red icon called “music” was started on my mac. I’ve never used that app as far as I can remember. But there it was, and there was one file open. Actually a video-recording of a session in a masterclass in serverless computing by 
        Gojko Adzic
         from few weeks earlier. But this was no video-player so it was only playing the sounds from the recording.
        
        I started listening to the file, and to my relief it sounded a lot like the hacker sounded on my computer. In this course we would break the group to different breakout-rooms. When that was on going the recording would have no sound, as nothing was happening in the main room.
