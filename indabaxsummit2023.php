                    <p class="mb-3">Deep Learning Indaba (DLI) is a premier yearly conference and community-driven project
                        aimed at enhancing and expanding Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
                        capabilities throughout Africa. It started in 2017 in South Africa as a discussion amongst the
                        like-minded. It has since evolved into a driver for AI and ML in the continent in various fields of
                        STEM. Through DLI, we are building capacity to solve African problems and promoting SDGs. The
                        conference gathers about 800 participants, among them: AI researchers, practitioners, and students
                        from different backgrounds to enhance collaboration, knowledge sharing, and capacity building. The
                        conference was first launched at the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg in 2017. In 2018, it
                        took place at Stellenbosch University in Cape Town, South Africa. And in 2019 we hosted the same
                        global conference at Kenyatta University, Kenya. The emergence of Covid-19, disrupted our
                        conferences for the years 2020 and 2021. The year 2022, the conference resumed and was hosted at
                        SupCom University, Tunisia.</p>

                <p class="mb-3">The conference has provided support to all Africa countries by gathering smaller gatherings in each
                    country to ensure continuous teaching and presentations in Deep learning. The small gatherings in
                    each African Countries is named: Deep Learning IndabaX. IndabaX was founded in 2018 to support
                    and build Machine Learning communities within Africa to provide support beyond the annual Deep
                    Learning Indaba, allowing more individuals to participate in the artificial intelligence and Machine
                    Learning discourse. IndabaX refers to a series of independently organized activities that take place
                    in several African countries throughout the year. Local communities host IndabaX events, which
                    provide forums for students and researchers to engage with Deep Learning and AI subjects in a more
                    localized and inclusive manner

                    IndabaX has had a tremendous impact in various ways. Firstly, it has aided in the democratization
                    of access to Artificial Intelligence education and resources by bringing together prospective
                    researchers and practitioners who might not have been able to attend the main Indaba conference. It
                    has made deep learning education more accessible and inclusive by organizing events in many
                    African countries, building a sense of community and collaboration among participants. The
                    summits have aided in the development of local Artificial Intelligence ecosystems across Africa. It
                    has stimulated the development of new AI-focused initiatives, enterprises, and research projects by
                    linking individuals with shared interests and providing them with a forum to present their work.
                    This has aided the continent's general progress of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
                    competence and innovation.
